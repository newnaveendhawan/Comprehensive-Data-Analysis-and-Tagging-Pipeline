# Comprehensive Data Analysis and Tagging Pipeline
## Overview
This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis on a provided dataset. The workflow includes column-wise analysis, data cleaning, insights generation, and tagging of free-text fields to derive actionable recommendations for stakeholders. The primary goal is to deliver clean, tagged data, visualizations, and a detailed report summarizing key findings.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
#### 1. Column-wise Analysis
###### Detailed data type, uniqueness, distribution & stakeholder relevance.

#### 2. Data Cleaning
###### Missing value handling
###### Categorical standardization
###### Numerical formatting & outlier treatment

#### 3. Critical Column Identification
###### Top 5 columns with business relevance
###### Insightful visualizations (at least 3)

#### 4. Text Feature Generation
###### Tags from free text fields (e.g., failure conditions, components)

#### 5. Summary Report
###### Cleaned data + EDA report
###### Key findings, actionable insights, and data discrepancies

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was provided via email. It contains both structured and free-text fields that were analyzed and processed to generate insights and tags.

## Deliverables
The following files are included in this repository:
#### Cleaned Dataset: A CSV/Excel file containing the cleaned and tagged records.
#### Detailed Report: A PDF document summarizing column analysis, data cleaning steps, visualizations, and key takeaways.
#### Python Scripts: All Python scripts used for analysis, cleaning, tagging, and visualization.
#### Visualizations: At least three visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms) highlighting key insights.
